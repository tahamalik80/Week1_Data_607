# FiveThirtyEight Data Tidying & Transformation Assignment

## Overview

This assignment focuses on practicing data tidying and transformation in R using a real-world dataset from [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/). You'll select an interesting dataset, study its context and associated article, and produce a reproducible R Markdown analysis that demonstrates import, cleaning, and summarization steps. The goal is to create an analysis-ready data frame with meaningful columns, and to reflect on findings and possible extensions.

## Assignment Steps

1. **Dataset Selection**
   - Browse [FiveThirtyEight datasets](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/) and choose one that interests you.
   - Read the associated GitHub documentation and FiveThirtyEight article.

2. **Data Import & Transformation**
   - Write R code to import the data directly from a public source (e.g., GitHub, AWS S3)—do not use local files!
   - Transform the data as needed:
     - Select a subset of relevant columns.
     - Include a target variable (if applicable).
     - Rename columns for clarity and replace any non-intuitive abbreviations.

3. **R Markdown Document Structure**
   - Begin with an **Overview**: 2–3 sentences summarizing the FiveThirtyEight article, plus a link.
   - Include your transformation R code, with clear comments and readable output.
   - Conclude with a **Conclusions/Findings and Recommendations** section:
     - Summarize your analysis.
     - Suggest possible extensions, verification, or updates to the original work.

4. **Formatting Requirements**
   - Each major text block should have at least one header (e.g., ## Overview) followed by narrative text.
   - (Optional) Add exploratory data analysis graphics as desired.

5. **Submission & Reproducibility**
   - Place all code and narrative in a single R Markdown (.Rmd) file.
   - Publish your solution to [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/).
   - Post the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository.
   - Provide direct URLs to your GitHub repo and RPubs file in your assignment submission.

- **Code Quality:** Clear, well-commented R code for tidying and transformation.
- **Documentation:** Overview and conclusions headers with descriptive text.
- **Output:** Clean, analysis-ready data frame with readable columns and (if applicable) target variable.
- **Submission:** RPubs and GitHub links provided.
